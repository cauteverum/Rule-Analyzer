Before begining, what you should do first is to run this command 
"python manage.py --help" 
After running this command, code let you know how to use it. 
I definitely offer that you define 'exempt' in way shown at --help command. 
If you don't define 'exempt', some rules create lots of logs especially local to outside rules
